###SET UP###

#Setting Up Pythonanywhere#
Firstly, set up a pythonanywhere account.
This can be done at https://www.pythonanywhere.com/registration/register/beginner/.

NOTE: If you are in Europe, in order to comply with GDPR, you should use the EU
hosted site. A box should pop-up when you register. 
If not, try at https://eu.pythonanywhere.com/registration/register/beginner/

Now, you should click on the 'Open Web tab' button.
Click 'Add a new web app'
Take a quick note of your domain name (It can be found later), then press next.
Select 'Flask', then 'Python 3.9 (Flask 2.0.0)'
Press next.

NOTE: Pythonanywhere sites are supported indefinitely, but to save servers,
sites are automatically disabled after 3 months. You will recieve an email
warning you that this will happen. In order to renew the site for another
3 months, simply use the 'Run until 3 months from today' button on the web
app page.

#Setting Up Time Zones#
From the web app page, scroll down to the 'Code' section, and click on the 'WSGI configuration file'
Add this code the the page, underneath 'import sys'

	import os
	import time

	os.environ["TZ"] = "Europe/London"
	time.tzset()
	
NOTE: Replace 'Europe/London' with your appropriate contient/city if you aren't using GMT/BST time.

#Setting Up The Code#
In order to set up the code, click on the 'Files' tab at the top of the page.
Click 'mysite/' in the directory list.
Press the 'delete' button (the bin) next to 'flask_app.py'.
Click 'Open Bash console here' above the file list.
Enter this into the console

	git clone https://github.com/1Sparky1/O-Book
	
Now enter

	cd O-Book
	
Assuming you get no errors, everything is now set up correctly.
Use the burger menu (three bars in the top right) to select 'Consoles'.
Click the X next to 'Bash console ******'.
	
#Setting Up The Config Files#
The next file to set up is the config file. Click on the 'Files' tab again.
Select 'mysite/' from the directory list, then 'O-Book/'.
Open 'config.txt' in the file list.
Change the options to the appropriate values, click the 'Save' button in the top right.

#Generating Project Skeleton#
The final step in setting up the site is to run the setup script.
To do so, open a new bash console in the 'O-Book' directory.
Enter

	python project_setup.py
	
Assuming you get no errors, everything is now set up correctly.
Use the burger menu (three bars in the top right) to select 'Consoles'.
Click the X next to 'Bash console ******'.
